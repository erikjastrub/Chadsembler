# Chadsembler
An Assembly Language Interpreter used as a learning resource to teach computer science students with.

LMC is a model assembly instruction set used by the OCR computer science curriculum

This was my computer science coursework project, my client was my teacher and the stakeholders were his computing students.

Upon analysing the initial requirements of the chadsembler, python 3.10 was the language of choice.
Python 3.10 is portable, minimal and allows for prototypal development.

Currently the Chadsembler is used in a school environment to teach computer science students about low level constructs such as assembly language.

Chadsembly is a superset of LMC and offers a range of additional features making it more valuable as a learning resource:
-Procedures
-Additional registers
-Additional customisability (more memory, registers, clock speed)
-Addressing modes
-A larger instruction set including bitwise manipulation and mask instructions.

Being my coursework project, a lot of the code is over-commented and certain design choices (such as the use of inheritance) were made to make it easier to mark and demonstrate a rich understanding of OOP constructs.

The chadsembler was given a mark of 70/70.
